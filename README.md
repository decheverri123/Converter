# Converter

To run this program, run Converter.py straight from your IDE (such as Visual Studio Code) or open the terminal in the enclosing folder and run `python3 Converter.py` (note if this doesn't work try `python Converter.py` instead)
To edit the string you wish to convert, change it in the Coverter.py file.
The result will be in the sample.json file.
